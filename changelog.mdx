## Overview

Use this changelog to record how JSONViewer.AI evolves over time. Each entry should capture what changed in a given release so users can understand new capabilities, fixes, and any breaking behavior.

This page is a **template**: it does not list real historical releases. Maintainers should replace the placeholder content below with actual release notes as new versions are published.

<Callout kind="info">

JSONViewer.AI runs fully in the browser as a free JSON viewer, validator, and beautifier. When you update behavior, performance, or UI, document it here so users know what to expect.

</Callout>

## How to use this changelog

Use one `<Update>` block per release. For each release, try to capture:

- **Version identifier**: a semantic version, hash, or short label.
- **Release date**: the day the change became publicly available.
- **Highlights**: what matters most to users (features, fixes, improvements, known issues).
- **Impact**: anything users must do differently (for example, breaking changes or changed shortcuts).

## Template for maintainers

Use the examples below as patterns. When you add real releases:

- Replace the `label` with an ISO date (for example, `2025-01-15`).
- Replace the `description` with your actual version or label (for example, `v1.2.0` or `Initial public release`).
- Update the `tags` array to reflect the type of change (for example, `["feature"]`, `["bugfix", "improvement"]`, `["breaking"]`).
- Edit or remove any sections that do not apply.

<Callout kind="tip">

Copy an existing `<Update>` block, paste it below the most recent one, and then edit the values. Keep the newest release at the top so users see the latest changes first.

</Callout>

<Update label="YYYY-MM-DD" description="vX.Y.Z" tags={["feature", "improvement"]}>

## Summary

Briefly describe the focus of this release in 1–3 sentences. For example:

- Introduced improvements to handling large JSON files and added new viewing options.
- Refined validation behavior and improved error messaging for invalid JSON.

## New features

List any new capabilities users can rely on, such as:

- New ways to view or navigate JSON data.
- Additional validation options or formats.
- Enhancements to beautify or minify behavior.

Example placeholders (replace with real items):

- Added an option to adjust indentation when beautifying JSON.
- Introduced a new panel to display validation errors alongside the source.

## Improvements

Document behavior that stayed compatible but works better now, such as:

- Performance improvements for large files.
- UI refinements.
- More informative messages or tooltips.

Example placeholders:

- Improved load performance for large JSON inputs.
- Polished the layout for a clearer separation between input and output.

## Bug fixes

Describe user-visible bug fixes. Be specific enough that affected users can recognize their issue:

- Fixed rare crashes when pasting malformed JSON.
- Resolved incorrect highlighting for certain number formats.

## Known issues (optional)

If relevant, list outstanding issues users should be aware of. Remove this section when not needed.

- Example: Very large JSON files may still feel slow when expanding many nested nodes.
