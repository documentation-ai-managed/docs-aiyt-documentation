## Common questions about JSONViewer.AI

JSONViewer.AI is a free, browser-based JSON viewer, validator, and beautifier for working with JSON data.

<ExpandableGroup>

<Expandable title="What is JSONViewer.AI?">

JSONViewer.AI is an online tool that helps you work with JSON data in your browser. It focuses on three main tasks:

- Viewing JSON with syntax highlighting and a collapsible tree view
- Validating JSON structure with clear error messages
- Beautifying (prettifying) JSON so it is easier to read

It is especially useful when you copy JSON from APIs, logs, or configuration files and want to inspect or debug it quickly.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Who is JSONViewer.AI for?">

JSONViewer.AI is designed for:

- **Web developers** inspecting JSON from front-end apps or browser tools
- **API developers** working with request and response payloads
- **Data analysts** exploring JSON exports from services or data pipelines

If you regularly handle JSON and want a quick way to read, validate, or format it, JSONViewer.AI is for you.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Is JSONViewer.AI free to use?">

Yes. JSONViewer.AI is free to use in your browser. You can paste JSON, validate it, and beautify it without creating an account or paying for access.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What kinds of JSON does JSONViewer.AI support?">

JSONViewer.AI supports standard JSON, including:

- Top-level objects and arrays
- Nested objects and arrays
- Strings, numbers, booleans, and `null` values

For example, this is valid JSON you can view, validate, and beautify:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Ada",
    "tags": ["developer", "admin"],
    "active": true
  }
}
```

As long as your input is valid JSON, JSONViewer.AI can format and display it with syntax highlighting and a tree view.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How do I beautify or prettify JSON?">

1. Copy your unformatted or minified JSON.
2. Paste it into the JSONViewer.AI editor.
3. Use the beautify or format action to automatically:
   - Add indentation
   - Insert line breaks
   - Align nested structures

For example, this minified input:

```json
{"id":1,"name":"Compact","active":true}
```

is reformatted into a more readable structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Compact",
  "active": true
}
```

<Callout kind="tip">

Beautify first, then use the tree view to quickly expand or collapse nested sections of your data.

</Callout>

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Does JSONViewer.AI validate my JSON?">

Yes. JSONViewer.AI validates your JSON structure and helps you spot errors.

When your JSON is invalid, the viewer:

- Highlights the problematic area
- Shows an error message with the reason (for example, an unexpected character or missing quote)

You can then fix the JSON directly in the editor and re-validate immediately.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Does JSONViewer.AI support tree view and syntax highlighting?">

Yes. JSONViewer.AI provides:

- **Syntax highlighting** to visually distinguish keys, values, strings, and numbers
- A **tree view** so you can expand and collapse nested objects and arrays

This makes it easier to:

- Navigate deeply nested structures
- Focus on a specific part of your JSON
- Compare sections without scrolling through long raw text

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Is my data private? Does my JSON get uploaded to a server?">

JSONViewer.AI processes your JSON **locally in your browser**. According to the homepage:

- Validation and beautification are performed on your device
- JSON is not uploaded to a remote server for processing

This means your data stays in your browser tab while you work with it.

<Callout kind="info">

Close the tab or clear the editor when you finish to remove your JSON from view. Since processing is local, there is no server-side copy of your data.

</Callout>

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Can I use JSONViewer.AI for non-JSON data formats?">

No. JSONViewer.AI is focused specifically on JSON.

If your data is not valid JSON, you will need to convert it to JSON first. Once it is valid JSON, you can paste it into the viewer to:

- Validate the structure
- Beautify the output
- Inspect it in tree view

## Getting started and troubleshooting

If you are new to JSONViewer.AI or something looks wrong, follow these quick steps.

<Steps>

<Step title="Paste your JSON" icon="clipboard-list">

Paste your JSON into the editor as plain text. Make sure you include the full object or array, not just fragments.

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, JSON!",
  "success": true
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Check for validation errors" icon="alert-triangle">

Run validation or look for any highlighted errors.

Common issues include:

- Missing or extra commas
- Keys not wrapped in double quotes
- Unclosed braces or brackets

Fix the highlighted area and validate again.

</Step>

<Step title="Switch between raw and tree views" icon="layers">

Use the available views to explore your data:

- **Raw view** with syntax highlighting for quick edits
- **Tree view** to expand and collapse nested sections

If the tree view does not appear as expected, confirm that your JSON is valid first.
