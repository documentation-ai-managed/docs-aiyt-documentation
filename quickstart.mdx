description: Learn how to open JSONViewer.AI, add your JSON, validate it for errors, and beautify it for easier reading in just a few steps.

## Quickstart overview

JSONViewer.AI is a free online JSON viewer, validator, and beautifier. Use it to quickly check your JSON for errors and make it easier to read, all in your browser with no installation or signup.

The basic flow is:

1. Open JSONViewer.AI.
2. Paste or upload your JSON.
3. Validate to check for errors.
4. Beautify or view the formatted result.

All processing happens locally in your browser, so your JSON data is not sent to a server.

## Step-by-step: from raw JSON to beautified output

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open JSONViewer.AI" icon="globe">

    In your web browser, go to **[https://jsonviewer.ai/](https://jsonviewer.ai/)**.  
    The main page shows a JSON input area and options to validate and beautify your data.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your JSON" icon="upload">

    Paste your JSON directly into the main input area, or use the upload option to select a `.json` file from your device (see input options below for details).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate your JSON" icon="check-circle">

    Click **Validate** to check your JSON for syntax errors.  
    If there are problems, the tool highlights the issue and shows an error message so you know what to fix.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Beautify and view" icon="zap">

    Once your JSON is valid, click **Beautify** or **View** to format it with clear indentation.  
    Use the formatted view to scan keys and values more easily, inspect nested objects, and copy the cleaned-up result back into your project or tool.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="info">

  You can use JSONViewer.AI for quick checks while working with APIs, configuration files, or data exports. It is especially useful when you need to confirm that JSON from an API response is valid before using it in your application.

## Input options

You can add JSON to JSONViewer.AI in two simple ways.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Paste JSON" icon="clipboard">

    Paste JSON from your code editor, API client, browser devtools, or log file into the main input area.

    Example of a small JSON snippet:

    <CodeGroup tabs="Simple,Nested">
```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Sample item",
  "active": true
}
```
```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Taylor",
    "settings": {
      "theme": "dark",
      "notifications": {
        "email": true,
        "sms": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Upload file" icon="upload">

    If your JSON is already saved as a file:

    1. Click the upload or file selection control on the page.
    2. Choose your `.json` file from your device.
    3. Wait for the content to appear in the input area, then use **Validate** and **Beautify** as usual.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding the view

When you work with JSONViewer.AI, you typically see:

- **Input area**: Where you paste or load your raw JSON text.
- **Action controls**: Buttons such as **Validate** and **Beautify/View** that run checks or formatting on your JSON.
- **Formatted or preview area**: Where the beautified JSON is shown so you can clearly read keys, values, and nested structures.

You can switch between editing your raw JSON in the input area and reviewing the formatted result to make sure everything looks correct.

## Troubleshooting validation errors

If **Validate** reports an error or your JSON does not beautify as expected, check these common issues:

1. **Missing or extra commas**

   Make sure items in arrays and objects are separated by commas, and avoid trailing commas after the last item.

   ```json
   {
     "items": [
       1,
       2,
       3
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Mismatched brackets or braces**

   Confirm that every opening bracket `[` has a matching closing bracket `]`, and every opening brace `{` has a matching closing brace `}`.

3. **Unescaped quotes inside strings**

   If a string contains double quotes, ensure they are escaped.

   ```json
   {
     "message": "He said \"hello\" to everyone."
   }
   ```

4. **Invalid JSON vs. JavaScript**

   JSON does not allow comments or trailing commas. Remove any line comments like `// comment` or `/* comment */` before validating.

If you continue to see errors, try pasting a smaller portion of your JSON to isolate the problem. For more guidance on working with JSONViewer.AI, see the [Introduction](/introduction), the main [Guide](/guide), or the [FAQ](/faq).
