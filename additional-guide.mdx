JSONViewer.AI always processes your JSON locally in the browser. You paste or upload JSON, then validate, beautify, and inspect it using both a formatted view and a tree view.

If you are new to the app, start with the [Introduction](/introduction) and [Quickstart](/quickstart), then return here for these deeper workflows.

## Workflow 1: Debugging an API response {#workflow-api-debugging}

Use this workflow when you receive an unexpected API response and need to understand what is going on.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="When to use this" icon="info">

You are calling an HTTP API and you see:

- Missing or unexpected fields in the response.
- Nested objects that are hard to inspect in your editor or browser console.
- JSON errors such as trailing commas or invalid structure.

JSONViewer.AI helps you validate and explore the JSON structure quickly.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Who this is for" icon="users">

- Web developers inspecting client-side fetch or XHR responses.
- API developers debugging server responses or integration tests.
- Anyone working with REST or JSON-based APIs who needs to see the full response clearly.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture the JSON response" icon="download">

Copy the raw JSON payload from:

- Your browser network panel.
- A tool such as `curl` or an API client.
- A log file, test output, or error report.

Make sure you copy the full JSON body, not just a screenshot.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste and validate in JSONViewer.AI" icon="check-circle">

Open JSONViewer.AI and paste the JSON into the input area, or choose the upload option if you have the response saved as a file.

Use the validation feature to check that the JSON is well-formed. If there are errors, the viewer will highlight the problem area so you can spot:

- Missing or extra commas.
- Unclosed brackets or quotes.
- Truncated responses.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Beautify and inspect the structure" icon="chevron-right">

Use the beautify or pretty-print action to reformat the JSON with indentation and line breaks. Then:

- Scan the syntax-highlighted view to confirm key fields such as `status`, `message`, or `data`.
- Switch to the tree view to expand or collapse nested objects and arrays.
- Compare what you see to the API contract or your expectations.

This makes it easier to find:

- Fields that are `null` or missing.
- Values in the wrong type, such as strings instead of numbers.
- Deeply nested keys that are hard to see in a flat view.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Narrow down the problem" icon="target">

Use the tree view to focus on problematic branches of the response:

- Drill into error objects to see detailed error codes.
- Compare the current response with a known-good response by opening them in separate browser tabs.
- Copy clean, pretty-formatted snippets to share in bug reports or chat.

Once you understand the problematic structure, adjust your API or client code accordingly.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflow 2: Cleaning JSON data before analysis {#workflow-data-cleaning}

Data analysts often receive JSON logs, exports, or event streams that need basic cleanup before loading into analytics tools.

<Callout kind="info">

JSONViewer.AI is designed for interactive viewing and light transformation, not heavy ETL. Use it to validate, inspect, and spot issues before you run larger batch jobs.

</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load a sample of your dataset" icon="upload">

Select a representative slice of your JSON data:

- A single log file.
- A small exported sample from an event stream.
- A subset of records from a data lake or object store.

Paste the content into JSONViewer.AI or upload the file. If the data is newline-delimited JSON, you can paste a smaller subset of lines at a time.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate and identify structural issues" icon="alert-triangle">

Run validation to confirm that the sample is valid JSON. Use the syntax highlighting and error messages to locate:

- Lines that are not valid JSON.
- Mixed structures (for example, some items are objects, others are arrays).
- Fields that change type across records.

If validation fails because the dataset is line-based, focus on one or a few lines at a time to identify bad records.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use beautify and tree view to understand fields" icon="bar-chart">

Use beautify to reformat the JSON, then open tree view to explore typical records:

- Expand a few example objects to list commonly present fields.
- Note field names, types, and nesting depth.
- Identify fields that will become columns or dimensions in your analytics tools.

Use this understanding to design downstream transformations in your scripting or data pipeline tools.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract a clean schema example" icon="check-circle">

After you confirm the structure:

- Copy a single, representative record from the beautified view.
- Use it as a documentation example of the dataset structure.
- Share it with engineers or teammates when coordinating changes.

Because everything stays in your browser, you can safely inspect sensitive data samples without uploading them to external services.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflow 3: Reviewing JSON configuration files {#workflow-config-review}

Developers frequently work with JSON-based configuration files such as app settings, build configs, or feature flags. JSONViewer.AI helps you review these files without editing them directly.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Config examples" icon="code">

Common JSON configuration scenarios:

- Frontend or backend app settings.
- Feature flags or rollout configurations.
- Build or deployment configuration files.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Why use JSONViewer.AI" icon="shield">

- Validate that config files are syntactically correct before committing.
- Use tree view to quickly compare related sections between versions.
- Read complex nested options more easily than in a raw text editor.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the configuration JSON" icon="folder-open">

From your editor or repository:

- Copy the full config file content.
- Or export a generated JSON config from your build system.

Paste or upload the JSON into JSONViewer.AI.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate and beautify the config" icon="check">

Run validation to catch syntax issues such as:

- Trailing commas after the last item.
- Incorrect quoting of keys or values.
- Mismatched brackets or braces.

Then use beautify to normalize indentation and spacing so that the structure is consistent and easier to read.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Inspect key sections in tree view" icon="search">

Switch to the tree view to:

- Expand logical sections such as `database`, `features`, or `logging`.
- Confirm that required keys are present and set to expected values.
- Quickly see nested options without scrolling through long files.

If you have multiple versions, open them in separate browser tabs and toggle between them to visually compare important branches.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Share safe snippets with your team" icon="users">

When you find a misconfiguration or you need a review:

- Copy just the relevant branch from the beautified view.
- Paste it into code review comments or documentation.

This avoids sharing unnecessary secrets while still providing clear context around the configuration.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example JSON snippets and usage patterns

Use these examples as starting points for pasting into JSONViewer.AI when exploring the workflows above.

<CodeGroup tabs="API response,Event log" show-lines={true}>

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid request payload",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "code": "invalid_format",
      "detail": "Email must contain an at symbol"
    }
  ],
  "requestId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

```json
{
  "event": "user_signup",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "plan": "pro",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "landing_page",
    "campaign": "winter_promo"
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

You can:

- Paste these snippets into JSONViewer.AI to practice validation and tree exploration.
- Modify fields to match your own API or event structures.
- Use variations of them when debugging or documenting your own systems.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs for these workflows

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Why does my JSON fail validation even though the API says it is fine?" default-open="true">

This usually means the text you pasted is not exactly the raw JSON body. Common issues:

- Extra text before or after the JSON, such as log prefixes or HTTP headers.
- Multiple JSON objects pasted together without wrapping them in an array.
- Error pages or HTML responses instead of JSON.

Try copying only the response body from your tool, or paste a smaller portion at a time to isolate the problem. For general usage questions, see the [FAQ](/faq).

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="My dataset is too large to paste. How should I use JSONViewer.AI?" default-open="false">

JSONViewer.AI works best with small to medium JSON samples. For very large datasets:

- Select a representative subset of records.
- Paste or upload only a single file or chunk at a time.
- Use JSONViewer.AI to understand the structure and potential issues, then apply the findings to your larger processing pipeline.

If you need help choosing a good sample, review the basic recommendations in the main [Guide](/guide).

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Can I safely inspect sensitive data in JSONViewer.AI?" default-open="false">

Yes. JSONViewer.AI processes JSON locally in your browser; the data is not sent to a server for processing. This makes it suitable for inspecting confidential responses, configuration files, or data samples, subject to your local device and browser security policies.
