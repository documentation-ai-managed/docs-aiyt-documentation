## Introduction

JSONViewer.ai is a free, web-based JSON viewer, formatter (beautifier), and validator. It helps you turn cluttered JSON into a clean, readable format, check that the structure is valid, and explore nested data without getting lost.

Everything runs directly in your browser. There is no installation, signup, or account required. You simply open the site, paste or upload your JSON, and start working with it immediately.

## Overview

JSONViewer.ai is designed to make everyday JSON tasks fast and approachable for both technical and non-technical users. It is helpful whenever you need to read, clean up, or verify JSON without writing code or using complex tools.

It is commonly used by:

- **QA engineers** who need to inspect responses, compare payloads, and confirm that data is structured correctly.
- **Product managers** who review JSON samples shared by engineering or vendors.
- **Support teams** who receive JSON logs or exports from customers and need to understand what is going on.
- **Developers** who want a quick way to view, validate, and reformat JSON outside of their editor or IDE.
- **Non-technical users** who occasionally receive JSON in tickets, emails, or tools and just want it to be readable.

Typical use cases include:

- Inspecting JSON responses from web services or tools.
- Reviewing JSON logs, exports, or debug output for issues.
- Validating configuration files or feature flags stored as JSON.
- Cleaning up JSON before adding it to documentation, tickets, or knowledge base articles.
- Converting compact JSON into a human-friendly format for review and discussion.

## Quickstart

Follow these steps for your first time using JSONViewer.ai:

1. **Open the site**

   Go to: `https://jsonviewer.ai/` in any modern web browser.

2. **Paste or upload JSON**

   - Paste JSON directly into the main input area, or  
   - Use the upload option (if available in your browser) to load a JSON file.

3. **View and format (beautify) JSON**

   - Use the Beautify or View action to reformat your JSON.
   - The tool will add indentation and line breaks so the structure is easy to read.

4. **Validate the JSON**

   - Click the Validate option to check that your JSON is well-formed.
   - If there are problems, the tool will show you where the syntax error occurs.

5. **Search keys and values**

   - Use the search box to find specific keys, values, or fragments within the JSON.
   - This is useful for large payloads where scrolling is difficult.

6. **Copy the formatted output**

   - Once you are satisfied with the formatted and validated JSON, copy it from the output area.
   - Paste it back into your application, documentation, ticket, or any other tool you use.

## Key Features

### JSON formatting and beautification

- Automatically reformats JSON with clear indentation and line breaks.
- Makes nested objects and arrays much easier to read and review.
- Helps you prepare JSON for sharing in tickets, documentation, and reviews.

### Expand and collapse structure (tree view)

- Shows JSON as an interactive, hierarchical structure.
- Lets you expand or collapse objects and arrays to focus on the parts you care about.
- Reduces scrolling and makes large payloads more manageable.

### JSON validation

- Checks your JSON for structural issues such as missing commas or unmatched brackets.
- Highlights where the error occurs so you can quickly correct it.
- Helps you confirm that JSON is safe to use in other tools or systems.

### Search within JSON

- Allows you to search for specific keys, values, or phrases.
- Helps you quickly locate relevant sections in large or complex JSON documents.
- Reduces time spent manually scanning through data.

### Ease of use

- Clean, focused interface with clear actions like Validate and Beautify/View.
- Works well for both occasional and frequent users.
- No need to learn commands or configuration options.

### No setup required

- Runs entirely in the browser, with no installation or plugins.
- Does not require an account, login, or registration.
- Accessible from any modern browser, making it easy to share a link with teammates.

### Local processing and security

- Validation and beautification are performed locally in your browser.
- JSON is not sent to a remote server as part of normal use.
- This reduces exposure risk when working with internal or confidential data.

## FAQs

### Do I need an account?

No. JSONViewer.ai does not require an account, login, or registration. You can open the site in your browser and start using it immediately.

### What JSON formats are supported?

JSONViewer.ai supports standard JSON text. This includes:

- JSON objects and arrays.
- Nested structures with strings, numbers, booleans, and null values.
- Typical configuration and data payloads that follow standard JSON syntax.

If your content is valid JSON, the tool should be able to view, format, and validate it.

### Why am I seeing validation errors?

Validation errors usually mean the JSON is not well-formed. Common issues include:

- Missing commas between items.
- Extra trailing commas.
- Unmatched or missing brackets or braces.
- Keys or strings that are not wrapped in double quotes.

When you validate, the tool will point to the location where the problem was detected. Fix the highlighted issue and run validation again.

### Can I use it for testing?

Yes. JSONViewer.ai is useful for testing scenarios such as:

- Checking that JSON examples you share in documentation or tickets are valid.
- Verifying that JSON from tools or exports is correctly formatted.
- Manually exploring how different JSON structures look before using them elsewhere.

It is a visual aid and validation helper rather than a full testing framework, and it does not replace automated tests in your applications.

### Is it safe to paste sensitive data?

JSONViewer.ai processes your JSON locally in your browser, and the validation and formatting do not require sending data to a server. This helps keep your data private.

That said, you should still follow your organization's security policies. Avoid pasting highly sensitive information (such as passwords, full payment details, or personal identifiers) when it is not strictly necessary, and consider masking or anonymizing data before using any online tool.
